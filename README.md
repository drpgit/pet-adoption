# Pet Adoption Agency

#### A simple pet adoption page, for practice with objects

#### By **David Perry**

## Description

This is a simple page (only two pet types at the moment), for practicing with creating and managing objects.

## Objectives

-	Each new pet created with show up on the right, as a styled object with avatar, name, breed, adoption status, and a button to click to adopt.
- Filter buttons at the top allow you to display objects by type, adoption status, or all.
- Clicking to adopt a pet will change the class/color of the object, disable the adopt button, add/remove classes for filtering.


## Setup/Installation Requirements

No setup/installation is necessary for this one, it's just a web page with an external javascript file.  It also relies on Bootstrap for styling and jQuery due to laziness.
